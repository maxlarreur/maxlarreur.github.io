        <h3>Nine-banded armadillo spatiotemporal behavior near the northern edge of their expanding distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Nine-banded armadillos (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>) have expanded their range northward and eastward and have behaviorally plastic diurnal activity patterns. However, landscape features influencing their distribution and activity are generally unknown in recently colonized areas. We used occupancy modeling and activity analysis to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of armadillos at multiple spatial scales in newly colonized areas near the leading edge of their northerly range in southern Illinois. We found na√Øve occupancy of armadillos a decade ago was <0.01 and has experienced a >30-fold increase, potentially bolstered by climate change and anthropogenic land use practices. Predicted occupancy was 0.00 to 0.92 across our study extent. Expansion of armadillos may continue as land use practices continue to create seminatural refugia and dispersal corridors in forested areas along roadways.

        <h3>The precipitous decline of a gray fox population</h3>
        <p>
          This chapter focuses on the gray fox population throughout southern Illinois. We use independent data collected from two larger-scale camera trapping projects conducted throughout the southern 16,000 km<sup>2</sup> of Illinois. Using these independent datasets, we develop a "past", "expected", and "contemporary" model for gray fox occupancy to identify potential changes in their space use and distribution. Unfortunately, our results indicated a dramatic decline in gray fox occupancy over a decadal time period, with decreased occupancy in preferred forest habitats.

        <h3>Decadal temporal dynamics and potential niche separation amongst carnivores</h3>
        <p>
          Using two independent datasets collected from larger-scale camera trapping projects conducted throughout the southern 16,000 km<sup>2</sup> of Illinois, we quantify behavioral stability and changes for native and domestic carnivores. Native species include coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>), bobcat (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>), gray fox (<em>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</em>), striped skunk (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>), and raccoon (<em>Procyon lotor</em>).
